# Testing speed of different cpp instruments
(sorry for my cpp code)
## Usage
in the directory:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
```
and the structure with options of the command:
```
./start.sh [number of experiments] [input file] [output file]
```
if there is line "results are still equal" then everything is ok
during the work script will make `./cmake-build-debug/tmp/` folder, it will be deleted till the end of working of the script
## My results
for 100 experiments 
first way (reading words one by one from the file) Number 1
second way (reading whole file into memory, then read symbol by symbol from space to punctual) Number 2
third way (reading whole file into memory, using boost::regex to find number of occurence) Number 3
